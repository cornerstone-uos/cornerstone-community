## Terms of Use

CORNERSTONE is an open-source foundry and is part of University of Southampton. Our PDKs are made publicly available, free of cost, without requiring an NDA agreement. That said, we are bound by the policies of the United Kingdom government on export-controlled and/or dual-use designs, subject to annual reviews, government guidance and updates.

By contributing to and benefiting from the contents of CORNERSTONE Community repository, the users are considered to have agreed to the terms of [TAPR Open Hardware License](https://tapr.org/the-tapr-open-hardware-license/). Additionally, contributors are subject to the terms of [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).

## Formatting guidelines

We accept contributions in two tiers:

- **Basic submission**: Submissions that aim to populate the repository with ready-to-use, purpose-built templates that involve .GDS files, with little to no circuit-level metadata information.
- **Advanced submission**: Submissions that aim to provide building blocks and intermediary components that can be used within other building blocks. Circuit-level information regarding the ports and modes are mandatory.

For both submission types, we encourage the inclusion of simulation and experimental data, either in a raw or post-processed data format, or as a DOI link to an open-access publication that holds such information.

For a detailed formatting guideline, please see the [Formatting Guidelines](./FormattingGuidelines.md)
