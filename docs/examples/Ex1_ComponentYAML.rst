Below is the breakdown of an exemplary YAML file for a component, a 1x2 MMI, which has one input and two output ports, all optical. The original component file can be found `here <../../Si_220nm_active/components/SOI220nm_1310nm_TE_RIB_2x1_MMI.yaml>`_

First, let's define the name of the file.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: SOI220nm_1310nm_TE_RIB_2x1_MMI

This should be identical to the GDS file name (without the file extension).
Continuing with the component type,

.. code-block:: yaml

   component_type: MMI1x2                 

``component_type`` is not allowed to be arbitrary within the Wavephotonics' YAML format - these are specified in the `allowed list of components <../wp_format/components_list.rst>`_ . Another requirement from Wavephotonics is explicit specification of the modes going through the ports. 

.. code-block:: yaml

   modes:                                 
     - mode_numbers:                        
       - 0                                     
       - 0
       polarisation: TE                     
       wavelength: 1310                     

Here, we have defined ``modes``, which has only one mode entry, TE_00 mode at 1310nm wavelength. When defined globally for the component this way, the ``modes`` field will be assigned to all the ports of the component. We move on to defining the ports:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ports:                                 
   - name: o1                               
     port_type: optical                     
     center:                                 
     - 0                                      
     - 0
     orientation: 180                        
     cross_section: rib_1310nm_TE
   - name: o2                                                   
     port_type: optical                        
     center:                                 
     - 123.6
     - 1.52500
     orientation: 0                                        
     cross_section: rib_1310nm_TE         
   - name: o3
     port_type: optical
     center:
     - 123.6
     - -1.525
     orientation: 0
     cross_section: rib_1310nm_TE

Here, we defined the three ports within this MMI. First port ``o1`` is the input port, and is facing the -x direction, hence its ``orientation`` is 180. It has a cross-section ``rib_1310nm_TE``, which will be described in ``*/cross-sections/cross_sections.yaml`` - it will be presented as a cross-section example later on. Ports ``o2`` and ``o3`` are outputs, they face +x direction (0 degree orientation), with their centres offset by ``1.525 um`` from ``y=0`` line. 

Below we demonstrate port-level mode definition within a grating coupler's YAML. The component is a 1D grating coupler for c-band operation in SiN - the original component file can be found `here <../../SiN_300nm/components/SiN300nm_1550nm_TE_STRIP_Grating_Coupler_v1p2.yaml>`_

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: SiN300nm_1550nm_TE_STRIP_Grating_Coupler_v1p2   
   component_type: GratingCoupler1D                      
   ports:                                                
     - center:

       orientation: 180
       port_type: optical
       cross_section: strip_1550nm_TE                  
       modes:                                              
       - mode_numbers:                                      
         - 0                                                   
         - 0
         polarisation: TE                                      
         wavelength: 1550                                       

We defined the first port, an optical port with cross-section ``strip_1550nm_TE`` and facing -x. It is defined for TE_00 mode at 1550nm: ``modes`` went a level down in hierarchy to be a field of ``ports``. The second port is a vertical port, which requires a different set of fields  

.. code-block:: yaml

   ports: # Kept here to display the indentation - this line does not exist in the original file
     - center:                                             
       - 325.81                                              
       - 0
       name: vertical_te                                  
       port_type: vertical_te                             
       orientation: 0.0                                 
       width:  10.0                                  
       coupling_angle_cladding: 13.659
       fibre_modes:                                        
       - fibre_type: SMF-28                                  
         wavelength: 1550                                    
                                                           

- Here, ``port_type`` is specified as ``vertical_te`` from the `allowed list of ports <../wp_format/ports_list.rst>`_ . 
- For vertical ports, we are allowed to define a ``width`` instead of a ``cross-section`` - e. g. ``10.0`` here. 
- Another important parameter is ``coupling_angle_cladding`` - this is the relative angle of the light travelling within the cladding. This component was designed for a 20 degree fibre angle over SiO2 cladding, hence ``coupling_angle_cladding = arcsind(sind(20)*n_air/n_siox) = 13.659``. If the device had been air-clad, ``coupling_angle_cladding`` would have been set to ``20.0``.
- Lastly, we defined ``fibre_modes`` to specify the possibly different fibres to be used across different settings; i. e. it is possible to use ``780HP`` for 780nm operation and ``SMF-28`` for 1550nm operation over the same grating coupler by defining an additional entry to ``fibre_modes``, using the fibres listed in the `allowed list of fibres <../wp_format/fibres_list.rst>`_.
