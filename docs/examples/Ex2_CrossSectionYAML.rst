Below is the breakdown of an exemplary YAML file for cross-section definition, for ``Si_220nm_active`` platform in this case. The original file can be found `here <../../Si_220nm_active/cross-sections/cross_sections.yaml>`_. The described cross-sections also exist as GDS files with identical names within the same folder (see `cross-sections <../../Si_220nm_active/cross-sections/>`_ folder).

First, we start by defining ``strip_1310nm_TE``, a strip waveguide cross-section designed to work for TE mode at 1310nm.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: strip_1310nm_TE
    xs_type: strip
    width: 0.4
    materials: Si
    minimum_bend_radius: 10
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 3
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 0.4
    modes:
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TE
      wavelength: 1310
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TM
      wavelength: 1310

``xs_type`` needs to be chosen from the `allowed list of cross sections <../wp_format/cross_sections_list.rst>`_. We define the total width of the cross-section ``width``, the materials and minimum bend radius.  
The ``layers`` field involves the geometries (position and width) of the layers that constitute the cross-section. For this strip cross-section, we only have GDS Layer 3/0 (the ``layer`` entry), 0.4 microns long (``width: 0.4``), sitting at the centre of the cross section (``offset: 0``).

We move on to define ``modes``, this will include all the modes that this cross-section supports. A certain cross-section will be able to support across a broad wavelength regime, of course, but we are only interested in the wavelengths that are interesting to simulate (extract the s-parameters for). Usually this boils down to a short spectral range around the design wavelengths of the component set, here the o-band. This cross-section supports a TE and TM mode at 1310nm, hence we define two mode entries for TE_00 and TM_00 at 1310nm.  

Moving on to a rib cross-section, we have:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: rib_1310nm_TE
    xs_type: rib
    width: 10.4
    materials: Si
    minimum_bend_radius: 25
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 3
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 0.4
    - layer:
      - 5
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 10.4
    modes:
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TE
      wavelength: 1310

As the rib waveguide is comprised of a narrow rib (layer 3/0, 0.4 microns wide) and a wide slab (defined by the protection layer 5/0, with a total width of 10.4 microns), we will need to define two layer entries. These layers are concentric (``offset`` s are 0). Another difference with ``strip_1310nm_TE`` is the lack of TM mode definition here - ``rib_1310nm_TE`` simply does not support the TM mode.  

Next, we define the remaining optical cross-sections:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: strip_1550nm_TE
    xs_type: strip
    width: 0.45
    materials: Si
    minimum_bend_radius: 10
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 3
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 0.45
    modes:
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TE
      wavelength: 1550
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TM
      wavelength: 1550
  - name: rib_1550nm_TE
    xs_type: rib
    width: 10.45
    materials: Si
    minimum_bend_radius: 25
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 3
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 0.45
    - layer:
      - 5
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 10.45
    modes:
    - mode_numbers:
      - 0
      - 0
      polarisation: TE
      wavelength: 1550

We then define the electrical contacts for the heaters (see `Heater <../../Si_220nm_active/components/Heater.gds>`_ component) and the detectors (see `Isolated Detector <../../Si_220nm_active/components/SOI220nm_1550nm_TE_IsolatedDetector.gds>`_ component). For metal layers, we use ``minimum_bend_radius: 0``.

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: dc
    xs_type: dc
    width: 80
    materials: metal1
    minimum_bend_radius: 0
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 13
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 80
  - name: detector
    xs_type: dc
    width: 100
    materials: metal1
    minimum_bend_radius: 0
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 13
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 100

Lastly, we define the modulator connections, which are expected to support the modulator for 28 Gb/s operation - hence deeply in the RF regime. RF contact are usually defined together to allow for custom routing options that preserve path differences. We use ``xs_type: png`` because the port has a ``positive - negative - ground`` geometry. We also define the three contact regions under the cross-section through setting different offsets - (see `SOI220nm_1310nm_TE_MZI_Modulator <../../Si_220nm_active/components/SOI220nm_1310nm_TE_MZI_Modulator.gds>`_)

.. image:: ../static/modulator_tri.png
   :width: 600px
   :align: center

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: modulator_tri
    xs_type: png
    width: 269
    materials: metal1
    minimum_bend_radius: 0
    layers:
    - layer:
      - 13
      - 0
      offset: -100
      width: 69
    - layer:
      - 13
      - 0
      offset: 0
      width: 69
    - layer:
      - 13
      - 0
      offset: 100
      width: 69

All of the cross-sections defined here have corresponding GDS files to help with parsing the YAML files. The GDS file for a cross-section should contain a 50 micron-long structure along x-axis, with the profile alongside y-axis is defined by the corresponding cross-section.
