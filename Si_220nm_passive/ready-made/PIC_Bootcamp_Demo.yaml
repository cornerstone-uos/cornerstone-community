  - While there is substantial overlap between the component designs compared to the Educational Kit, PIC Bootcamp Demo chip only contains one etch depth (120nm), and one metal layer (Ti/Al) for quick fabrication.
  - Manual for the educational kit can be found in [docs/_static/PIC_Bootcamp_Manual.pdf](../../_static/PIC_Bootcamp_Manual.pdf)
